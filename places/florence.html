    <p class="lead drop-cap">
      Nestled along the banks of the Tennessee River in northwest Alabama, Florence is a city that punches far above its weight. With a population of around 40,000, it might look like just another small Southern town on a map. But look closer, and you'll find a place that helped shape American music, architecture, and culture in ways that still resonate today.
    </p>

    <h2 id="river">A City Born from the River</h2>
    <p>
      Florence was founded in 1818, the same year Alabama became a territory. The city's founders chose this spot for a reason: the Tennessee River. At this point, the river drops over a series of shoals - shallow, rocky areas that made navigation treacherous but created incredible hydroelectric potential. These shoals would later give the entire region its name and identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original city plan was designed by Ferdinand Sannoner, an Italian surveyor who laid out wide streets in a Renaissance-inspired grid pattern. Today, downtown Florence still follows this original plan, with Court Street serving as the main thoroughfare just as Sannoner intended over 200 years ago.
    </p>

    <h2 id="handy">The Father of the Blues Was Born Here</h2>
    <p>
      On November 16, 1873, William Christopher Handy was born in a log cabin in Florence. He would grow up to become known as the "Father of the Blues" - not because he invented the form, but because he was the first to write it down, publish it, and bring it to the wider world.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="pull-quote">
      "The blues? That came from right here. From these fields, from that river, from the souls of people who worked hard and dreamed harder."
      <cite>W.C. Handy Museum Docent</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Handy's most famous composition, "St. Louis Blues" (1914), became one of the most recorded songs in history. But his roots were here, in Florence, where he first heard the work songs and spirituals that would later influence his groundbreaking compositions. His birthplace, a humble log cabin on College Street, is now the W.C. Handy Birthplace, Museum and Library - a testament to how a small-town kid changed American music forever.

    <h2 id="rosenbaum">Frank Lloyd Wright's Southern Masterpiece</h2>
    <p>
      In 1939, Stanley and Mildred Rosenbaum commissioned a house from Frank Lloyd Wright. They were a young couple - he was 26, she was 24 - and they wanted something modern for their corner lot in Florence. What they got was a masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rosenbaum House is the only Frank Lloyd Wright-designed structure in Alabama and one of the finest examples of his Usonian style anywhere in the world. Wright believed beautiful, functional homes should be available to middle-class Americans, and the Rosenbaums' house proved it was possible. The family lived there for over 60 years before donating it to the city.
    </p>

      <figcaption class="photo-credit container">The Rosenbaum House, Frank Lloyd Wright's only Alabama design. Photo: City of Florence</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Today, the Rosenbaum House is open for tours and stands as a reminder that great architecture can happen anywhere - even in a small Alabama town.
    </p>

    <h2>The Indian Mound: 2,000 Years of History</h2>
    <p>
      Long before European settlers arrived, this land belonged to the Chickasaw people. And long before them, the Woodland period inhabitants built what we now call the Florence Indian Mound - a ceremonial earthwork that has stood for nearly 2,000 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 43 feet tall and covering nearly two acres at its base, it's the largest domiciliary mound in the Tennessee Valley. Archaeologists believe it served as a ceremonial center, with the remains of a structure - possibly a temple - once standing at its peak. Today, it's a National Historic Landmark and a humbling reminder that Florence's history stretches back far beyond 1818.
    </p>

    <h2>More Than Music</h2>
    <p>
      Florence isn't just about the past. The University of North Alabama, founded in 1830, brings thousands of students to the city each year. The downtown district has experienced a renaissance in recent decades, with locally-owned restaurants, boutiques, and galleries filling the historic storefronts along Court Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tennessee River remains central to life here. Wilson Dam, completed in 1924, tamed the shoals that once made the river treacherous and brought electricity to a region that had been in darkness. Today, the river provides recreation, tourism, and a defining sense of place.
